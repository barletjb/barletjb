**`Junior Web Developer (Java | Spring Boot | AWS) & Osteopath(True) & Surfer.`** 

I’ve traded sciatic pain for stack traces and Java errors — the debugging is just as intense.
Currently training at ENI school, and with a mentor who catches my mistakes before they become Git history.
Breaking things in Java, fixing them with Spring Boot, and acting like it was intentional.
Learning DevOps, CI/CD, and cloud the hard way — one deploy at a time.
Not the fastest yet, but always pushing forward.
Looking for real-world projects, strong teams, and chances to grow with every pull request.
